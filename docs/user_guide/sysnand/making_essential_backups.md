# Making Essential Backups and dumping keys

    It is critical to make these backups. Do not skip these steps.

## Making a NAND Backup

!!! danger "Important"
	A NAND backup is crucial. They can be used to restore the device to a working state in case of emergencies.

	Once the backup is finished, **keep it somewhere safe.** The best backup is the one you have but never need, and the worst backup is the one you need but never made. To save space, it's recommended to compress the end-result with a `.zip` file or something similar.

	It's highly recommended that you use an SD card that is formatted to FAT32 and has at least 32 gigabytes of space free. This will still work on smaller cards, but it's not ideal.

### Instructions

!!! tip ""

    1. Enter RCM and inject the Hekate payload
    2. Use the touch screen to navigate to `Tools` and then `Backup eMMC`
    3. Tap on `eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1`
       - This may take a few minutes
    4. Tap on `Close` to continue, then tap on `eMMC RAW GPP`
       - This will take a long time
       - On FAT32 SD cards or cards that have less than 32 gigabytes of space available, the NAND will be split into 1 or 2 gigabyte parts.
          - Hekate will stop producing these parts when it runs out of space. When this happens, do the following:
          - Power off your system
          - Insert your SD card into your PC
          - Move all files from the `backup` folder on your SD card to a safe location on your PC
          - Insert your SD card into your Switch
          - Enter RCM again, inject Hekate again, and continue the backup by tapping on `Tools` > `Backup eMMC` > `eMMC RAW GPP`
          - Repeat the process until the NAND is completely dumped
    5. Press `Close` > `Home` > `Power Off`
    6. Insert your SD card into your PC
    7. Copy the `backup` folder on your SD card to a safe location on your PC

### Getting your Console's Unique Keys

!!! danger "Important"
    These keys are critical to have. In an extreme emergency, they can be used in conjunction with your NAND backup and other tools to restore your console to a working state.

!!!tip ""
    1. Enter RCM and inject the Hekate payload.
    2. Tap the `Payloads` option, then press Lockpick_RCM.bin.
    3. If Lockpick_RCM asks you to select between SysNAND and emuMMC, choose SysNAND by navigating with the volume buttons and pressing the power button. If not, continue with step 4.
    4. If Lockpick_RCM prompts you to `Reboot to Sept`, press power or either volume button to do so. A "sept by Atmosphere" logo will then display, followed by Lockpick_RCM starting again. If it does *not* prompt you, continue on to step 5.
    5. Lockpick_RCM should now inform you that your keys have been saved to `/switch/prod.keys` on the SD card.
    6. Press any button to return to the main menu.
    7. Navigate to 'Power off' with the volume buttons and select it with the power button.
    8. Insert your SD card into your PC.
    9. Copy `prod.keys` from the `switch` folder on your SD card to a safe location on your PC (it is suggested to copy it to the same place that you copied your NAND backup to).
