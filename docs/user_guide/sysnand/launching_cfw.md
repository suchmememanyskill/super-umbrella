# Launching CFW

Now that the preparation work is out of the way, we're finally ready to launch custom firmware on the Switch.

Unlike systems such as the DSi, Wii, or 3DS, Switch CFW is currently volatile- it will only work as long as your Switch is on. As soon as your Switch completely loses power for any reason (shutting down, battery dying, etc.), CFW will no longer be active and you will need to follow these instructions again.

&nbsp;

### Instructions

!!! tip ""
    1. Power on your Switch into RCM, and inject the Hekate payload
    2. Navigate to `Launch` using the touch screen
    3. Find `Atmosphere FSS0 SYS` and launch it

Your Switch is now booting into Atmosphere.

To verify Atmosphere launched properly, open the Settings applet, and navigate to System. You should see `AMS` next to the version number, as well as an `S` at the end, indicating you are booted into sysMMC.

### Launching the Homebrew Menu

You will now be able to launch the Homebrew Menu by opening the album or by holding the R button while launching any game (including demos/cartridges), or application (e.g. Youtube/Hulu). If R is not held, the game or application will launch like normal.
    
!!! warning "A note about using the album for the Homebrew Menu"
    - Using the album for the Homebrew Menu instead of a game or application has several limitations, including but not limited to: a smaller amount of available memory (RAM), as well as being unable to launch a full-featured web browser. It is strongly recommended to launch homebrew through applications or games instead.
    
!!! tip "Adding new applications"
    - Place homebrew applications (`.nro` files) into the `switch` folder on your SD card.

### What the included homebrew applications do
