> [!WARNING|label:Backing up your existing Nintendo folder]
>	Before we start, if you are using a microSD card already as a storage device for your games, you will want to back up your `Nintendo` folder that is on the root of your microSD card to a safe place on your computer. This folder contains your downloaded games and game updates.

2. Navigate to `SD Format` and press the power button to enter the SD format menu.
	- If you can't find the SD Format option, make sure that your SD card is inserted and select Mount SD.
3. Navigate to `Format for EmuMMC setup` and press the power button to confirm.
5. Read the warning, and press power after 10 seconds to format your SD card.
	- Note: This will delete all data on your SD card. Make sure you backed up your Nintendo folder!
	- This will take about 5 minutes.
6. Press any button to return to the main menu.
7. Navigate to `Exit` and press the power button to enter the Exit menu.
8. Navigate to `Reboot to RCM` and press the power button to reboot to RCM. It's now safe to eject your sd card for the next part of the guide.
