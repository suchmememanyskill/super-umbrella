# Blocking Updates {docsify-ignore-all}

You can add custom DNS to your WiFi connection that will block all communication with the Nintendo servers. This will stop any updates and reporting to Nintendo, but it will prevent use of the eShop and online games.

We will be using [90DNS](https://gitlab.com/a/90dns), a community-run custom DNS server. If you prefer, you can run your own DNS server following the instructions on the [GitLab repository.](https://gitlab.com/a/90dns/blob/master/SELFHOST.md)

### **Setting up a new connection via WiFi**

4. Press `OK` to close the error message.
5. Press `Close` when it offers to display more details about the error.
6. When asked if you want to re-enter the password, pick `View Settings`.
